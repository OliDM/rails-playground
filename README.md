# README

On This repo I will be playing around with several technologies using rails as the backend, the list goes more or less as the following:
[] React hooks.
[] husky.
[] Docker.
[] Kubernetes.
[] Service Workers.
[] React + GraphQL.
[] React + GraphQL + SSR.
[] SPA + React + GraphQL + SSR.
[] E2E testing.
[] Testing react components.
[] State machines.
[] Manage custom webpack configurations or at least optimize them performance wise.
